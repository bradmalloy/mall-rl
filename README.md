Arundel, a grungy, post-apocalyptic roguelike set in a mall.

## Introduction
I created Arundel as a practice roguelike to get me ready for 7DRL 2021 and to familiarize myself with rot.js, a roguelike toolkit made for the browser. Arundel is the name of the 20th biggest mall in America, and just sounded cool.
