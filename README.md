Arundel, a grungy, post-apocalyptic roguelike set in a mall.

## Introduction
I created Arundel as a practice roguelike to get me ready for 7DRL 2021 and to familiarize myself with rot.js, a roguelike toolkit made for the browser. Arundel is the name of the 20th biggest mall in America, and just sounded cool.

## Closing Notes

Finished up working on Feb. 15th since I didn't have a strong feeling about where the game was going, and had other ideas I wanted to explore. It's kinda a game right now - it has items, enemies, combat, collision. However, it doesn't work online via Netlify, which is my preferred deployment method at the time. I looked briefly into Webpack and Browserify, but didn't follow through.
